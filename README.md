# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-DL
Used Kaggle API to fetch data. Create a kaggle.json from kaggle dashboard to access the data.
Developed varoius DL models based on Transfer Learning and Training from Scratch along with some ensemble techniques.
Also developed a new CNN model and optimized some of the parameters using Genetic Algorithm.
